A small demo, to complement one of my blog posts, which is a reply to http://mattiasgeniar.be/2012/03/30/bad-orm-is-infinitely-worse-than-bad-sql/

It will simply run a few DQL queries, outputting the generated SQL queries, and then iterate over the result sets. If you want to actually run the app, or check the results for yourself:

 - Clone the repo somewhere, cd into the directory
 - Get composer from Packagist (easiest way: "curl -s http://getcomposer.org/installer | php")
 - Get the dependencies by running "php composer.phar install"
 - Give your db details in the setup.php file, line 2-3 (doesn't have to be root)
 - Create an empty database named "ormdemo"
 - Run php doctrine.php orm:schema-tool:create (This will create the database tables)
 - Run the app with php run.php

Obviously this is not my usual coding style, I throw way more globals around :)
